<p>AJAX is not a new programming language.</p>
<p>AJAX is a technique for creating fast and dynamic web pages.</p>
<p>Async=false

To use async=false, change the third parameter in the open() method to false: <br>
<br>
<b>xmlhttp.open("GET", "ajax_info.txt", false);</b><br>
<br>
Using async=false is not recommended, but for a few small requests this can be ok.<br>
<br>
Remember that the JavaScript will NOT continue to execute, until the server response is ready. <br>
If the server is busy or slow, the application will hang or stop.
